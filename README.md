# DiceRollGame
Here I developed a Dice Roll Game in which there will be two players , each player can throw the dice any number of  times and each time value come on dice will be get added to his score , the condition is that he should not get "One" on Dice ,if he will get one then the score he previously made will become zero and the control will get passed to other player . So its upon us to pass the control to another player without getting one on the dice , if we do so then our current total will get added to the major total of the player .
